# Hypothesis testing error types

Whenever we are testing a hypothesis, there are four possible outcomes.

1. Null hypothesis is true but we reject it - this is *Type 1* error.
2. Null hypothesis is true and we retain it - all good here.
3. Null hypothesis is false and we reject it - great.
4. Null hypothesis is false and we retain it - this is *Type 2* error.

So, Type 1 error occurs whenever we reject null hypothesis when, in fact, it is true. Type 2 error occurs whenever null hypotehesis is false and we still accept it.

## Example

Null hypothesis: The beverage is fine to drink.
Alternative hypothesis: The beverage is too hot to drink.

Four possible outcomes:

1. Null hypothesis is true but we reject it - you think the beverage is too hot so you wait to drink it, but it's actually fine now and by the time you drink it, it's too cold. Type 1 error here.
2. Null hypothesis is true and we retain it - you decide the beverage is fine to drink now and indeed it is.
3. Null hypothesis is false and we reject it - you decide the beverage is too hot to drink now so you wait until it's perfect.
4. Null hypothesis is false and we retain it - you decide the beverage is too hot to drink but in fact it's perfect now. By the time you end waiting, the drink becomes cold. Type 2 error here.
